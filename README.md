## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I cereated this app to improve my understanding of full stack development using the MERN stack. I learned alot during the course of making this app including using Material-ui, component separation, creating a schema and using mongdDB. This has inspired me to get a deeper understanding of the mern stack and to keep learning through trying new things.
